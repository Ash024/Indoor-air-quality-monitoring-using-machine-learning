Here's a step-by-step guide to configure:

1. Prepare code on Google Collab:
   - Ensure that your Python code on Google Collab is fully functional and performs the necessary tasks related to indoor air quality monitoring.
   - If you're using any external libraries or dependencies, make sure they are installed in your Collab environment. You can install them using `!pip install <package>` commands within your Collab notebook.

2. Save your code:
   - Save your Google Collab notebook (.ipynb file) to your Google Drive. This step ensures that you can access the notebook programmatically using Google Drive APIs.

3. Set up Flask application:
   - Define the routes, templates, and logic necessary to display the indoor air quality data and receive user inputs.

4. Integrate Google Drive with Flask:
   - Use the Google Drive API to access your Collab notebook from your Flask application. You'll need to set up authentication to authorize access to your Google Drive files.
   - Once authenticated, your Flask application can read the Collab notebook (.ipynb file) from your Google Drive and execute it programmatically.

5. Display indoor air quality data:
   - Modify your Flask application to display the indoor air quality data obtained from running the Collab notebook.
   - You can present this data using HTML templates, charts, or any other visualization tools supported by Flask.

By following these instructions, you can effectively configure your code hosted on Google Collab with a front end using Flask, creating a seamless indoor air quality monitoring system.
